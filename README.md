# cancer-diagnostic-system
We divide this project into 3 modules. 

  In module 1, we implemented two color-based image segmentation algorithms: kNNs, GMMs-EM and LDA (to be merged into this repo). 
  
  In module 2, we are doing feature extraction, feature selection and dimensionality reduction.
  
  In module 3, we plan to try some deep learning techniques to realize the final steps for the system.
